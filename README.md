# PizzaTheHutt

This is a super simple pizzeria project to dabble in java programming

## Future good-to-haves:
Copy constructors for the data objects

## Konown bugs:
1, GSON wrapper class JsonParser does not work when used with a template in a higher level class like UserManager. Switched to Jackson.
